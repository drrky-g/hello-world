general discussion and ideas

Hey I'm Derrick and I am learning design and web development at school. I've started learning to code with HTML and CSS in October
and have started teaching myself how to write javascript. I hope to try and get a job to work in web development this summer to
gain some experience.

Thanks for stopping by!
